    <h2>Pantry</h2>
    <p>A <strong>pantry</strong> is a room where beverages, food, and sometimes dishes, household cleaning chemicals, linens, or provisions are stored. Food and beverage pantries serve in an ancillary capacity to the kitchen. The word "pantry" derives from the same source as the Old French term paneterie; that is from pain, the French form of the Latin panis, "bread" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantry" target="_blank" >Wikipedia.</a></p>
