    <h2>WORKAREA</h2>
    <p>A <strong>workplace</strong> is a location where someone works for his or her employer, a place of employment. Such a place can range from a home office to a large office building or factory. For industrialized societies, the workplace is one of the most important social spaces other than the home, constituting "a central concept for several entities: the worker and his/her family, the employing organization, the customers of the organization, and the society as a whole".[1] The development of new communication technologies have led to the development of the virtual workplace, a workplace that is not located in any one physical space <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workplace" target="_blank" >Wikipedia.</a></p>
